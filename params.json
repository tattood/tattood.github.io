However, people still would like to get them, whether it is related to something important and meaningful to them or it just looks aesthetic. Yet, not everyone is getting happy after they got it, since there is no chance to make a precise decision which tattoo to get and where to get before seeing it.\r\n\r\nWhen somebody has decided to get a tattoo to a decided place, it is drawn to her/his body temporarily. After that, the person who’ll get the tattoo, decides whether he/she wants it. Since, this process is time-consuming and not repeatable for the people who are irresolute, we wanted to make it easier for the person and for the tattoo artist, by making it repeatable to see any tattoo, anywhere, anytime by just looking through the augmented reality camera.\r\n\r\n### Group Members\r\n\r\n* Ali Onur Geven\r\n* Anıl Sert\r\n* Beril Başak Tukaç\r\n* Nazlı Özge Uçan\r\n* Furkan Usta\r\n\r\n### Supervisor and Jury Members\r\n\r\n* [A.
